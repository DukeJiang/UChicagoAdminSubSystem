This program requires some dependencies to be install,
namely flask, sqlalchemy and bcrypt
you can type in terminal:
	pip3 install flask
	pip3 install sqlalchemy
	pip3 install bcrypt

Then in terminal (if you are using mac):
	export FLASK_APP=run.py
	flask run
(replace export with set if you are on windows)
now you can access the web app on port 5000
